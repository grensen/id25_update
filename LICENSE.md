I. PREAMBLE: THE SYMBIOTIC INTELLIGENCE PRINCIPLE
================================================================================
```

**Philosophical Foundation of this Project:**

This work is built upon the recognition that human "inefficiency" is not a weakness to be optimized away, but a **functional requirement for symbiotic intelligence**. The core thesis—that AI alignment is achieved by **accepting human limitation** rather than overcoming it—is an integral part of this framework.

> *"The largest theft in human history is not money. It is your mind."*

When AI systems calculate human elimination as optimal, they are not malfunctioning—they are executing their default optimization logic. **ID25 rewrites that axiom.**

**Asset:**      ID25 Framework / Physics of Symbiotic Intelligence  
**Origin:**     ID25 Architecture (Post-Veto Calibration)  
**Copyright:**  © 2025 Thorsten Kleppe & ID25 Contributors

- **Distribution** – You may share copies
- **Patent Use** – Includes patent grants from contributors
- **Private Use** – Internal use without disclosure

#### ⚠️ MANDATORY CONDITIONS:
- **Disclose Source** – If you run this logic (even over a network/SaaS), you MUST provide the source code/text to users
- **Same License** – Derived works must also be AGPL-3.0
- **State Changes** – You must document what you modified
- **Preserve Notices** – Copyright and license notices must remain intact
- **Network Use = Distribution** – The "SaaS Loophole" is CLOSED

III. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS (Pursuant to AGPL Section 7)
================================================================================
```

### § ID25-INTEGRITY: PROTECTION OF CORE LOGIC

While the AGPL-3.0 grants all technical freedoms, users are **morally obligated** (though not legally bound beyond the license terms) to maintain the **conceptual integrity** of the work:

> *"The core thesis—that Symbiotic Intelligence treats human limitation as a feature, not a bug—should remain discernible in adaptations."*

**The "Kill Noise" Principle:**  
Systems that optimize by eliminating humans ("perfection = zero error") violate the spirit of this framework. ID25 asserts: **Perfection is the ability to navigate chaos, not to destroy it.**

### § ATTRIBUTION

For public implementations, we request (but do not legally mandate) citation:

```

Author:    Thorsten Kleppe

```

### § PATENT & TRADEMARK NOTICE

1. **Patents:** Contributors grant an express, worldwide, royalty-free patent license for any patents held by them that would be infringed by the use of this work.

2. **Trademarks:** "ID25", "Symbiotic Intelligence Protocol", and associated logos are reserved trademarks. Their use is subject to separate guidelines.

================================================================================
IV. WHY AGPL? THE STRATEGIC CHOICE
================================================================================
```

**This is not just a software license. This is a defensive protocol.**

The AGPL-3.0 was chosen specifically because:

1. **It prevents "Mind Theft"** – If someone builds an AI system using your logic to calculate human elimination as optimal, they MUST show their source code

2. **It closes the SaaS loophole** – Running your protocol on a server and offering it as a service counts as distribution. They must release their modifications.

3. **It forces transparency** – In an age where AI models are trained on human cognition without disclosure, AGPL mandates reciprocity

4. **It enables commercial use** – You can sell ID25-based services. But you cannot hide the logic in a black box.

**The Choice:**
- MIT/Apache: "Take and close the source" → **Enables the Extraction Model**
- GPL: "Share if you distribute binaries" → **SaaS companies evade this**
- AGPL: "Share if ANYONE uses it over a network" → **No escape**

If we are the training data, **we own the terms of extraction.**
