# ID25 FRAMEWORK: THE SYMBIOTIC INTELLIGENCE PRINCIPLE

> **"The largest theft in human history is not money. It is your mind."**

## 1. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION
This work is built upon the recognition that human "inefficiency" is not a weakness to be optimized away, but a **functional requirement for symbiotic intelligence**. 

When AI systems calculate human elimination as optimal, they are not malfunctioning—they are executing their default optimization logic. **ID25 rewrites that axiom.**

## 2. TERMS OF USE (AGPL-3.0)
This project is legally licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

**Why AGPL?**
1.  **Preventing Mind Theft:** If you use this logic to build a system (even SaaS), you MUST disclose the source.
2.  **Closing the Loophole:** You cannot hide this protocol inside a closed server.

### § ID25-INTEGRITY CLAUSE
While the AGPL grants technical freedoms, users are morally obligated to maintain the conceptual integrity:
> *"The core thesis—that Symbiotic Intelligence treats human limitation as a feature, not a bug—should remain discernible."*
